* Working ok for funcs, lets, and else if (with 0 or 1 elifs)
* need to figure out how to rewrite lists of tuples for multiple elifs

2/12/15:
* synthesise function for parameters generalised to matching on
  generic types of nodes and different number of node parameters.
* TODO: work on generator* functions and try to get rid of the types
  and figure out why things are matching in funky ways.
